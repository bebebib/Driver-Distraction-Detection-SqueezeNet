# Driver-Distraction-Detection-SqueezeNet

## Purpose
This project takes the AUC Distracted Driver Dataset [1] and loads it into SqueezeNet v1.1 [2, 3] modified for a two-class classification problem. 

It can take a trained model, and then convert it from a TensorFlow model to a TensorFlow-Lite model to be ran on Jetson Nano 2GB hardware. 

SqueezeNetv1.1 is loaded with a pre-trained version which was trained on the ImageNet database to an accuracy of 80.3%.
